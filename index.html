                                <p>Our global food and land use system is a leading driver of environmental damage. It

                                    change, and it is the leading cause of the continuing conversion of the world’s

                                    Decoupling economic development from deforestation and forest degradation is complex
                                    and requires international collaboration by public and private sector actors to
                                    invest in and scale more productive, regenerative techniques for food production and
                                    new approaches to protecting forests and other critical ecosystems. A number of
                                    governments for example are already engaging on solutions through the <a

                                <h5>Strengthening and scaling <b> carbon markets for forests.</b></h5>
                                <h5> <b>“[we can] scale and strengthen carbon markets to support forest countries in

                                <p>Many of the tropical forest countries that have made important progress over the past
                                    decade or more on REDD+ are assessing how to strategically engage in voluntary and
                                    compliance carbon markets as a source of finance to reach their forest, climate and
                                    sustainable development goals. However, there are several challenges and barriers to
                                    the strengthening and scaling of such markets. For example, while demand for forest
                                    carbon credits increases, growth is constrained as tropical forest countries face
                                    capacity and technical barriers to participating in markets. There are also ongoing
                                    discussions and a lack of consensus on the role of different types of credits and
                                    there are divergent views on how to ensure that such markets are high integrity and
                                    delivering in line with the goals of the Paris Agreement. For the voluntary carbon
                                    market, several initiatives have launched in recent years that seek to clarify
                                    issues related to supply and demand side integrity with several institutions
                                    releasing guidance documents to this end (e.g., <a href="https://icvcm.org/"

                                    perform essential services: carbon sequestration, climate regulation, biodiversity

                                    insufficient and/or unsustainable for many lower income countries. New forms of
